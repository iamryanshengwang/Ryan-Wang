# Ryan-Wang
Hello, my name is Ryan Wang. I am currently pursuing a Master of Science in Imaging Science at Washington University in St. Louis, expected to graduate in May 2025. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Information and Computing Science from Shenzhen University.

My technical skills span across various programming languages including C, C++, Python, Go, Matlab, and SQL, and I am proficient in tools such as TensorFlow, OpenCV, Simulink, Blender 3D, Neo4j, and SQLiteStudio.

During my tenure as an Algorithm Engineer Intern at Lenovo, I developed a chatbot named "Prometheus" using Neo4j, py2neo and Streamlit. I actively participated in the development of the AIPC Concept within the Desktop Computing group. Previously, I interned as a Data Analyst at Sunshine Insurance Group, where I utilized Python and Excel to analyze and manage data.

My past project experience includes developing Ray Tracing software for brain tumor detection at Washington University School of Medicine, analyzing internet user behavior through data mining at Remin University of China, and creating an AI-based fire detection system for subway stations at Shenzhen University.

In addition to my technical expertise, I am fluent in English and a native Mandarin speaker. My interests include playing the piano and guitar, as well as swimming. I am passionate about leveraging my skills and experiences to contribute to innovative projects and make a meaningful impact in the field of imaging science and beyond.

I am looking for a software engineer or algorithm engineer job, and my CV is shown below. PLease hire me!!!
